## Description

Oswald, a brave and hungry cat, one day decides to dive to the bottom of lakes and oceans to hunt for fishes. What awaits him is an underwater world of intrigue, adventure and wits! As Oswald, outsmart fishes by learning their movements, use the environment to gain the upper hand and utilize traps to snag your meal.

Strategise your moves, navigate through various beautifully-decorated aquatic environments, employ spatial tactics to outwit the fishes and claim your next meal in this deceptively simple game!

Do you have the strategic talent and wits to embark on this underwater adventure? Play Catfishing and test out the waters!
History

This game was made in 6 weeks as a part of a game development module in the National University of Singapore. Our group was comprised of 4 people. The concept of the game took large inspiration from Paquerette Down the Bunburrows.

We presented this game during the School of Computing Term Project Showcase (STePS) and won 3rd place in the Games category by number of votes.
